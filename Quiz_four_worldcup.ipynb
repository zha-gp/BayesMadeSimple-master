    "### The World Cup problem\n",

    "In the 2018 FIFA World Cup final, France defeated Croatia 4 goals to 2.  Based on this outcome, we can answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How confident should we be that France is the better team?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the same teams played again, what is the chance Croatia would win?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we have to make some modeling assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Goal scoring can be well modeled by a Poisson process, so the distribution of goals scored by each team against the other is Poisson($\\lambda$), where $\\lambda$ is a goal-scoring rate, measured in goals per game.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For two random World Cup teams, the distribution of goal scoring rates is Gamma($\\alpha$), where $\\alpha$ is a parameter we can choose based on past results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine $\\alpha$, I used [data from previous World Cups](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269031/goals-scored-per-game-at-the-fifa-world-cup-since-1930/) to estimate that the average goal scoring rate is about 1.4 goals per game.\n",
