    "Here's a problem from David MacKay's book, [*Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms*](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/p0.html), which is the book where I first learned about Bayesian statistics.  MacKay writes:\n",

    ">\n",
    "> >\"When spun on edge 250 times, a Belgian one-euro coin came\n",
    "up heads 140 times and tails 110. ‘It looks very suspicious\n",
    "to me’, said Barry Blight, a statistics lecturer at the London\n",
    "School of Economics. ‘If the coin were unbiased the chance of\n",
    "getting a result as extreme as that would be less than 7%’.\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "> But [asks MacKay] do these data give evidence that the coin is biased rather than fair?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we have to make some modeling choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's assume that if you spin a coin on edge, there is some probability that it will land heads up.  I'll call that probability $x$.\n",
    "\n",

    "This formulation is similar to the 101 Bowls problem we saw in the previous notebook.\n",
    "\n",

    "To be honest, I don't really know.  To get started, I will assume that all values of $x$, from 0% to 100%, are equally likely.  Then we'll come back and try another prior.\n",
